# Stability Build System
System for base building games that includes basic stability and floating island detection.

This was made as an experiment to see what an improved version of the building system in Starboard would look like. It's not a complete game-ready solution. There are many performance improvements that can be made, especially to reduce the amount of transform parenting, but it works well enough for now.
